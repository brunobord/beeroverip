Beer Over IP
============


Beer Over IP is a simple (fake) protocol that gives someone the opportunity
to hand a beer over the internet.

The code used to power the beeroverip website is distributed under the terms of
the (dual) WTFPL/Beer-ware License. This means that you may:

    Do What The Fuck You Want with this code.

or

    Do whatever you want to do with this code, but if we meet in real life,
    you can buy me a beer.

See WTFPL and BEERWARE files for further information or go to:

* http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/
* http://people.freebsd.org/~phk/

How to use it?
==============

Just make a link to http://beeroverip.org and it's done. The person you are
offering the beer can click on the link and gets instant satisfaction!

Where does this idea come from?
===============================

A Lugradian named Matthew Walster, who you may know as ``dotwaffle`` once
tweeteed this:

    Opsview_IRC++ Big help guys, thanks! Now, there ought to be a site for
    BeerOverIP - Scred?

(ref: http://twitter.com/dotwaffle/statuses/886306622)

And this gave me the idea to buy beeroverip.org (and .net, but who cares) domain
name(s), and quickly fetch a picture of a glass of beer on flickr, upload a
quick and dirty HTML page demonstrating that Beer Over IP is not just a concept.
This can **happen!**

So, what's next?
================

See ``todo.txt`` file for further details.
