Your \"target\" clicks on it and he or she gets instant reward?\r\n\r\n## The default beer is nice, but ain't there any other?\r\n\r\nOf course! Just go to [the global list of beers](http:\/\/beeroverip.org\/all\/) and pick up the one you want to send over IP. You'll get a link to a specific beer that fits your needs. Hence you may send [stout to someone!](http:\/\/beeroverip.org\/stout\/)\r\n\r\nAin't it cool?\r\n\r\n## I can't find my favorite beer!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this website is not a beer anthology (yet). But you could help it by hunting for a Free (as in speech) picture of a beer (Flickr has tons of them) on the web, or take one picture by yourself, and publish it under a Creative Commons License. Once you have:\r\n\r\n* the name of the sort of beer,\r\n* a decent picture of it,\r\n* a copyright description, and the terms of the license,\r\n\r\ngo straight to [the BeerOverIP bug interface](https:\/\/bugs.launchpad.net\/beeroverip\/) and file a bug. The title may be: \"new beer: <this sort of beer> could be added to the list\". You may proceed by sending links to the picture and texts, or attach files in the bug report.\r\n\r\nIf your new beer is a nice candidate and fits the right criteria, it may be added to our database as soon as possible.",
